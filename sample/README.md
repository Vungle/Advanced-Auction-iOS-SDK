iOS Example
========================
This is a minimal example showing how to place interstitial and rewarded video ad into an iOS
application.

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Vungle Advanced Auction SDK, but is
compatible with Cocoapods and includes a Podfile. We recommend using Cocoapods
to reference the SDK. You can do this by running:

`pod update`

If you don't have Cocoapods installed, visit
https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3 to get started.

After running pod update, open the .xcworkspace by xcode to run the sample app.

Replace Your App ID and Placement ID
-----------------------
This example comes with a preconfigured app ID and placement IDs. You should create an app
and placements on https://vungle.com and use that app ID and placement IDs in your own app.
